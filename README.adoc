Version 0.4, 30-APR-2017

Nim Chess 3 is a simple chess game written from scratch in Nim language with a basic GTK3 GUI.

This is the third version. While the first release was basically a test for the Nim GTK3 bindings, and
the second release added a transposition table based on tables module from Nim's standard library,
this one uses a custom hash table. This restricts memory consumption drastically. Current version
uses about 340 MB of RAM, so playing on older hardware is no problem any more.

Additional I have tried to improve the code of the chess engine, so playing strength may be stronger, and
the basic GTK3 GUI indicates the position of last moved piece.

=== Properties

- written in Nim language
- basic GTK3 GUI
- only 1200 lines of code
- move generation is based on an old gnuchess idea
- core component is of course alpha-beta-prunning
- a transposition table is used to reuse old results

With a time limit of a few seconds per move computation is generally 7 ply deep
full width, with additional full capture analyses (quiescence search).  Special moves
like chess offers or captures are now deep extended, which should further increase
playing strength, but I have not really verified that.
In endgame
deep of 10 ply and more is archived -- now even the most difficult endgame
king vs king/bishop/knight is solved in few moves/seconds. And I have added a set based
history to prevent engine from repeating old positions.

Of course an opening library would increase playing strength, but I do not enjoy playing
against a database too much, so I do not really intend to add one.

The graphical user interface is very basic currently -- we play with white pieces against
computer. No undo, no hints. For next game we have to restart the program.

Maybe some day I will provide a more complete GUI. At least setting time limit and
choosing side would be nice. That is really not much work, but not very interesting.

Parallel computing would be interesting too, but the engine is strong already, and of
course parallel computing would increase power consumption, so maybe it is not that
useful.

For this release we need at least Nim v 0.16.1.

nim c -d:release board.nim

The shipped nim.cfg file is this:

----
$ cat nim-chess3/nim.cfg 
path:"$projectdir"
nimcache:"/tmp/$projectdir"
gcc.options.speed = "-march=native  -O3  -flto -fstrict-aliasing"
----

With gcc 6.3 this seems to generate the fastest executable with only 108 kB in size.
You may try your own options -- and maybe do first built without -d:release flag
to check for bugs.


It may be possible to use it on Windows as well, for MacOSX installation
seems to fail, as someone in Nim forum reported.

Of course support of installation by nimble package manager would be nice.
But there are still the name conflicts of GTK3 related modules with the legacy GTK2
shipped with Nim. Some months ago I started working on a new, gobject instrospection based
higher level GTK3 wrapper called nim-gi. So the name is different, and it may be possible 
to use nimble install with that module. But unfortunately that wrapper still needs much work.

The older nim-chess releases 1 and 2 are still available at https://github.com/ngtk3 -- I intend
to delete them when this release is a bit more tested.
